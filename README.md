### Dash

Simple dash app that allows me to quickly create hashed passwords and manage MySQL connections for dev instances. Also has built in task management for projects.

It is written completely in Angular and uses local-storage to persist the data in the browser.

#### To Build

* `git clone` the repo
* Navigate to the repository folder
* `grunt build` if you want to host the static files somewhere
* `grunt server` if you want to host locally on port 8000
